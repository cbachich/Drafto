# drafto 

Drafto is a Java based GUI that allows a fantasy sports league owner to input lottery numbers from his league's team owners. After inputting these numbers, a random number generator starts selecting numbers ranging from 1 to 9. When the first number of a team owner's selections is drawn, that number is highlighted and the next number becomes active. Afer all 5 numbers have been selected for a team, they receive the best draft spot availabe at that point.
